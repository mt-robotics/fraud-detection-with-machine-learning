# Processed Data Directory

This directory contains preprocessed data files ready for model training.

## Expected Files

After data preprocessing, you should see the following files:

- `X_train.npy` - Training features (with SMOTE balancing applied)
- `X_test.npy` - Testing features
- `y_train.npy` - Training labels (with SMOTE balancing applied)
- `y_test.npy` - Testing labels
- `X_train_original.npy` - Original training features (before SMOTE)
- `y_train_original.npy` - Original training labels (before SMOTE)

These NumPy files are generated by the data preprocessing pipeline and used by the model training code.

## How to Generate These Files

Run the data preprocessing script:

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

Or use the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb
```

## Note

This directory is kept in version control with `.gitkeep`, but the actual processed data files should be added to `.gitignore` to avoid committing large binary files.
