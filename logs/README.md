# Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the application.

## Contents

The following logs may be generated:

- `api.log` - API server logs
- `training.log` - Model training logs
- `preprocessing.log` - Data preprocessing logs

These files will be created automatically when you run the corresponding components.

## Log Management

In a production environment, consider:

1. Setting up log rotation to prevent log files from getting too large
2. Implementing proper log level filtering
3. Using a centralized logging system (like ELK stack or Loki)

## Note

This directory is kept in version control with `.gitkeep`, but the actual log files should be added to `.gitignore` to avoid committing them.
