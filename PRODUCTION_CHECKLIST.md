# Production Readiness Checklist

This document outlines the steps taken to make the project production-ready and what else might be needed depending on deployment requirements.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Code Quality
- Fixed bugs in the codebase
- Updated validation in API to use modern Pydantic v2 syntax with field aliases to support both uppercase and lowercase field names
- Implemented proper error handling for case sensitivity and column alignment in the API
- Removed unused imports
- Added proper error handling throughout the application
- Fixed Kaggle import issue in `download_data.py`

### Project Structure
- Added README files to important directories
- Created placeholder files to maintain directory structure in git
- Added comprehensive .gitignore file
- Created initialization script
- Set proper file permissions

### Reproducibility
- Structured data pipeline for consistent results
- Preserved train/test split in processed data
- Added model metadata storage
- Added random seed settings

### Containerization
- Improved Dockerfile with proper health checks, metadata
- Enhanced docker-compose.yml with network configuration, resource limits
- Ensured proper volume mounting for data persistence

### Documentation
- Added detailed README with setup and usage instructions
- Created data directory documentation
- Added API documentation
- Created model documentation

## ðŸ”„ When Running the Project

The following will be generated automatically when running the project:

1. **Data Files**
   - Raw data in data/raw/ (when downloading from Kaggle)
   - Processed data in data/processed/ (after preprocessing)

2. **Model Artifacts**
   - Trained models in models/ (after training)
   - Model metadata in models/
   - Model visualizations in models/

3. **Logs**
   - Application logs in logs/

## ðŸš€ Additional Production Considerations

Depending on your specific deployment environment, consider the following additional steps:

### Security
- [ ] Implement proper authentication for the API
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Implement API keys or OAuth for API access
- [ ] Set up HTTPS/TLS encryption

### Monitoring & Observability
- [x] Add Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- [x] Set up alerting for model performance degradation
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing
- [x] Configure centralized logging with Grafana

### Deployment
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Configure Kubernetes manifests for orchestration
- [x] Implement canary deployments for safe model updates

### ML Operations
- [x] Implement model versioning
- [x] Set up model monitoring for drift detection
- [x] Create retraining pipeline for automated model updates
- [x] Implement A/B testing for model comparisons

### Scaling
- [ ] Add caching for frequent predictions
- [x] Configure horizontal scaling for the API
- [ ] Optimize batch prediction capabilities
- [ ] Implement async processing for large workloads

### Compliance & Governance
- [x] Add model cards for documentation
- [x] Implement model explainability reports (SHAP)
- [ ] Add data lineage tracking
- [ ] Create privacy policy and terms of service

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Launch Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify the following:

- [ ] All tests pass (`pytest tests/`)
- [ ] Model performance meets business requirements
- [ ] API performance meets latency requirements 
- [ ] API handles both uppercase and lowercase field names correctly
- [ ] Documentation is up-to-date and consistent with implementation
- [ ] Logging is properly configured
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive and provides clear messages
- [ ] Security measures are in place
- [ ] Monitoring is configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are in place
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is correctly configured (if implementing GitHub Actions)
